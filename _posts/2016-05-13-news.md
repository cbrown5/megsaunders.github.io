## New Position at UQ  

I am starting a new position as a Research Fellow in the School of Geography, Planning and Environmental Management at the University of Queensland. My research will focus on how changes in land use, and thus changes in sediment erosion off land, affect coastal marine ecosystems. I'll be working closely with Carissa Klein and others in a great team of researchers. The research is funded by a grant from the Science for Nature and People Partnership (SANPP), a collaboration of The Nature Conservancy, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).
