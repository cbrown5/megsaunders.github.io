## Society for Conservation Biology and International Coral Reef Society Conferences 2016  

It has been a busy few weeks of conferencing. This week I attended the Society for Conservation Biology conference in Brisbane, where I presented my research on managing for impacts of sea-level rise on coastal marine ecosystems. In June I attended the International Coral Reef Society meeting in Hawaii. There I presented my research on impacts of wave energy on shallow coral reef flat and seagrass communities, and my research on using earthquake subsidence zones to understand how sea-level rise affects marine ecosystems.
