## Soapbox Science

When you think of a scientist, who is it that comes to mind? Chances are that you first think of someone male!

[Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org/?page_id=2609/) aims to challenge that preconception by showcasing women in science.
The event started in the UK, and this year will be held in Australia for the first time.

I'll be presenting “How sea-level rise will change our coasts, and what we can do about it”.
Other speakers will be presenting a wide range of topics, including math, physics, medicine, chemistry, and more.

Head to King George Square in Brisbane on August 20th 1-4pm to participate in this exciting event.
