I am honoured to receive a 2017 UQ Development Fellowship from the University of Queensland.

This prestigious fellowship from the University of Queensland will provide funding for my research on impacts of land-use change and management on marine ecosystems.

I'll be working closely with local industry partners as well as academic collaborators.
