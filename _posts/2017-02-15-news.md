## New Grant from the NESP Tropical Water Quality Hub

I am thrilled to be a co-author on a newly funded grant from the [National Environmental Science Program](http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp) 
[NESP Tropical Water Quality HUB](http://nesptropical.edu.au/). Our project, led by [Dr. Catherine Collier](https://research.jcu.edu.au/portfolio/catherine.collier/), is entitled
"Deriving ecologically relevant load targets to meet desired ecosystem condition for the Great Barrier Reef: 
a case study for seagrass meadows in the Burdekin region". You can find out more about the project [here](http://nesptropical.edu.au/index.php/round-3-projects/project-3-2-1/).
