## Moving to School of Chemical Engineering 

I am wrapping up my research in the [School of Earth and Environmental Science](https://sees.uq.edu.au/) 
and getting ready to start my new position as a Senior Research Fellow in the 
[School of Chemical Engineering](http://www.chemeng.uq.edu.au/) at the University of Queensland. 
I'll be collaborating closely with [Dr. Kate O'Brien](http://www.chemeng.uq.edu.au/obrien) and [Healthy Land and Water](http://hlw.org.au/)
to quantify the benefits of catchment (watershed) restoration on downstream marine ecosystems. My position is funded by a [UQ Development Fellowship](http://www.uq.edu.au/research/research-management/uq-fellowships).
