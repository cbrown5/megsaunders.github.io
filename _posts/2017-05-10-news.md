## NESP Seagrass Workshop

This week our research group met at James Cook University in Townsville to work on our NESP Tropical Water Quality Hub project 
"Deriving ecologically relevant load targets to meet desired ecosystem condition for the Great Barrier Reef: 
a case study for seagrass meadows in the Burdekin region"

The project is led by Dr. Catherine Collier, and involves collaborators at The University of Queensland, The Great Barrier Reef Marine 
Park Authority, and JCU.

As part of the workshop we toured some of the seagrass meadows at one of our study sites at Magnetic Island, Cleveland Bay.
