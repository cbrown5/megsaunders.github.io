## New paper out in PLoS Biology

My newest paper "Simple rules can guide whether land- or ocean-based conservation will best benefit marine ecosystems" 
was published this week in the prestigious journal PLoS Biology. 

Our study finds that marine restoration, rather than protection, might be the most cost-effective solution for coastal marine 
ecosystems suffering from human activities. This finding is contrary to the conventional wisdom that conservation should focus 
on either marine protection, or reduction of land-based threats.

Based on our model, we provide some simple rules of thumb to guide decision making for linked land-sea ecosystems in the 
absence of complex modelling.
