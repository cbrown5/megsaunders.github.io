        <p>
            I am a marine ecologist and oceanographer. I use modelling, field and laboratory techniques in my research. I focus on the effects of environmental variability and human actions on marine ecosystems.

            I currently focus on the effects of sea-level rise and land use change on coastal tropical ecosystems, with the aim of identifying management and policy recommendations to mitigate negative impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I collaborate widely with ecologists, engineers, geographers, conservation planners and lawyers. I am passionate about science communication and have produced an award winning science video.
