        <p>
            I am a marine ecologist and oceanographer. I use modelling, field and laboratory techniques to study human impacts on, and management of, marine ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of my research focuses on the effects of sea-level rise on coastal tropical ecosystems, with the aim of identifying management and policy recommendations to mitigate negative impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I collaborate widely with engineers, geographers, conservation planners and lawyers. I am passionate about science communication and have produced an award winning science video.
