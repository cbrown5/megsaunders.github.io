            I am a marine environmental scientist. My research focuses on the effects of environmental variability, human stressors, and management, on coastal and marine ecosystems. I use modelling, field and laboratory techniques in my research.

            I currently focus on the land use change on coastal ecosystems, with the aim of identifying management and policy recommendations to mitigate negative impacts.

            I collaborate widely with ecologists, engineers, geographers, conservation planners and lawyers. I am interested in science communication and have produced an award winning science video.
