            My research focuses on the effects of environmental factors, human stressors, and management actions 
            on marine ecosystems. My current research focuses primarily on the impacts of land use change on downstream 
            marine ecosystems. I aim to identify management and policy recommendations to mitigate negative impacts of human stressors. 
            I use a combination of modelling, field and laboratory approaches.

            Interdisciplinary collaborations are a foundation of my research program, and to this end I work closely with
            ecologists, engineers, economists, geographers, conservation planners and lawyers.
            My research has been funded in part through a number of competitive fellowships and awards.

            I firmly believe in the importance of communicating research beyond scientific publications.
            I communicate through public presentions, social media, traditional media, and by creating short videos.
