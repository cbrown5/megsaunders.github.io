I will soon be joining a team of talented women scientists in a <a href ="http://www.scienceweek.net.au/">National Science Week</a>   program for science outreach. We recently completed media and communication training in Brisbane.

It has been a busy few weeks of conferencing. This week I attended the Society for Conservation Biology conference in Brisbane, where I presented my research on managing for impacts of sea-level rise on coastal marine ecosystems. In June I attended the International Coral Reef Society meeting in Hawaii. There I presented my research on impacts of wave energy on shallow coral reef flat and seagrass communities, and my research on using earthquake subsidence zones to understand how sea-level rise affects marine ecosystems.

Exciting changes ahead. I am starting a new position in the School of Geography, Planning and Environmental Management at the University of Queensland. My research will focus on how changes in land use, and thus changes in sediment erosion off land, affect coastal marine ecosystems. I'll be working closely with Carissa Klein and others in a great team of researchers.

Congratulations to Dr Jimena Samper-Villarreal for being awarded her PhD at the University of Queensland. Her research made a big contribution to our understanding of how seagrass meadows sequester carbon ("Blue Carbon").
