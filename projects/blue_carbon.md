## Blue Carbon

<p>
Mangrove restoration projects are typically less costly than other marine ecosystems, largely because of volunteer efforts in developing countries and the relative ease of collecting mangrove seeds and recruits.

Coastal marine ecosystems including seagrass, saltmarsh and mangroves trap carbon in their tissues and sediments. This makes is less available to the atmosphere and therefore helps mitigate climate change. Quantifying the extent and function of blue carbon ecosystems is non-trivial since they occur in marine environments, which presents significant measurement and monitoring challenges. We use remote sensing and field techniques to measure the distribution and abundance of blue carbon ecosystems; field and laboratory techniques to measure the amount of carbon present; and modelling techniques to understand how environmental factors affect carbon stocks.
