Coastal ecosystems provide goods and services supporting human wellbeing. Climate change threatens coastal ecosystems and science based management strategies to lessen negative impacts are urgently required. My research on impacts of sea-level rise on coastal tropical ecosystems is being used to develop management strategies for coastal areas to benefit both people and ecosystems. My theoretical research identifies where there are opportunities to manage local stressors to ecosystems to minimize negative impacts of climate change.
