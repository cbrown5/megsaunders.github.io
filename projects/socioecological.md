A workshop on Socio-ecological issues in marine restoration </p>

Bringing about environmental change requires understanding human systems, as well as ecosystems. I have worked with lawyers, planners and economists at the intersection of social and ecological sciences. In Queensland, we looked at whether current environmental policy adequately protects marine life. I have also worked with economists and planners to find efficient compromises between social and ecological goals for coastal ecosystems.
